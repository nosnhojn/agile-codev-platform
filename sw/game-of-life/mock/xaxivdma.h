*
* This is the Xilinx MVI AXI Video DMA device driver. The DMA engine transfers
* frames from the AXI Bus or to the AXI Bus. It is in the chain of video
* IPs, which process video frames.
*
* It supports the following features:
*  - Continuous transfers of video frames, AKA circular buffer mode
*  - Continuous transfers of one specific video frame, AKA park mode
*  - Optionally only transfer a certain amount of video frames
*  - Optionally transfer unaligned frame buffers 
*
* An AXI Video DMA engine can have one or two channels. If configured as two
* channels, then one of the channels reads data from memory, and the other
* channel writes to the memory.
*
* For a full description of AXI Video DMA features, please see the hardware
* spec.
*
* The driver composes of three parts: initialization, start a DMA transfer, and
* interrupt handling.
*
* <b> Driver Initialization </b>
*
* To initialize the driver, the caller needs to pass a configuration structure
* to the driver. This configuration structure contains information about the
* hardware build.
*
* A caller can manually setup the configuration structure, or call
* XAxiVdma_LoopkupConfig().
*
* The sequence of initialization of the driver is:
*  1. XAxiVdma_LookupConfig() to get the configuration structure, or manually
*     setup the structure.
*  2. XAxiVdma_CfgInitialize() to initialize the driver and device
*  3. If interrupt is desired:
*     - Set frame counter using XAxiVdma_SetFrameCounter()
*     - Set call back functions for each channel. There are two types of call
*       backfunctions: general and error
*     - Enable interrupts that the user cares about
*
* <b>Start a DMA Transaction </b>
*
* If you are using the driver API to start the transfer, then there are two
* ways to start a DMA transaction:
*
* 1. Invoke XAxiVdma_StartWriteFrame() or XAxiVdma_StartReadFrame() to start a
*    DMA operation, depending on the purpose of the transfer (Read or Write).
*
* 2. Or, call the phased functions as the following:
*    - Call XAxiVdma_DmaConfig() to set up a DMA operation configuration
*    - Call XAxiVdma_DmaSetBufferAddr() to set up the DMA buffers
*    - Call XAxiVdma_DmaStart() to kick off the DMA operation
*
* If you are writing your own functions to start the transfer, the order of
* setting up the hardware must be the following:
*
* - Do any processing or setting, but do not start the hardware, means do not
* set the RUN/STOP bit in the XAXIVDMA_CR_OFFSET register.
* - After any reset you need to do, write the head of your BD ring into the
* XAXIVDMA_CDESC_OFFSET register.
* - You can do other setup for the harware.
* - Start your hardware, by setting up the RUN/STOP bit in the
* XAXIVDMA_CR_OFFSET register.
* - You can do other setup for the hardware.
* - If you are done with all the setup, now write the tail of your BD ring to
* the XAXIVDMA_TDESC_OFFSET register to start the transfer.
*
* You can refer to XAxiVdma_ChannelStartTransfer() to see how this order is
* preserved there. The function is in xaxivdma_channel.c.
*
* Note a Read VDMA could work with one out of multiple write VDMA instances
* and vice versa. The PointNum in structure XAxiVdma_DmaSetup decides which
* VDMA instance this VDMA is working with. 
*
* <b>Interrupt Handling </b>
*
* Each VDMA channel supports 2 kinds of interrupts:
* - General Interrupt: An interrupt other than error interrupt.
* - Error Interrupt: An error just happened.
*
* The driver does the interrupt handling, and dispatch to the user application
* through callback functions that user has registered. If there are no
* registered callback functions, then a stub callback function is called.
*
* Each channel has two interrupt callback functions. One for IOC and delay
* interrupt, or general interrupt; one for error interrupt.
*
* <b>Reset</b>
*
* Reset a DMA channel causes the channel enter the following state:
*
* - Interrupts are disabled
* - Coalescing threshold is one
* - Delay counter is 0
* - RUN/STOP bit low
* - Halted bit high
* - XAXIVDMA_CDESC_OFFSET register has 0
* - XAXIVDMA_TDESC_OFFSET register has 0
*
* If there is an active transfer going on when reset (or stop) is issued to
* the hardware, the current transfer will gracefully finish. For a maximum
* transfer length of (0x1FFF * 0xFFFF) bytes, on a 100 MHz system, it can take
* as long as 1.34 seconds, assuming that the system responds to DMA engine's
* requests quickly.
*
* To ensure that the hardware finishes the reset, please use
* XAxiVdma_ResetNotDone() to check for completion of the reset.
*
* To start a transfer after a reset, the following actions are the minimal
* requirement before setting RUN/STOP bit high to avoid crashing the system:
*
* - XAXIVDMA_CDESC_OFFSET register has a valid BD pointer, it should be the
* head of the BD ring.
* - XAXIVDMA_TDESC_OFFSET register has a valid BD pointer, it should be the
* tail of the BD ring.
*
* If you are using the driver API to start a transfer after a reset, then it
* should be fine.
*
* <b>Stop</b>
*
* Stop a channel using XAxiVDma_DmaStop() is similar to a reset, except the
* registers are kept intact.
*
* To start a transfer after a stop:
*
* - If there are error bits in the status register, then a reset is necessary.
* Please refer to the <b>Reset</b> section for more details on how to start a
* transfer after a reset.
* - If there are no error bits in the status register, then you can call
* XAxiVdma_DmaStart() to start the transfer again. Note that the transfer
* always starts from the first video frame.
*
* <b> Examples</b>
*
* We provide one example on how to use the AXI VDMA with AXI Video IPs. This
* example does not work by itself. To make it work, you must have two other
* Video IPs to connect to the VDMA. One of the Video IP does the write and the
* other does the read.
*
* <b>Cache Coherency</b>
*
* This driver does not handle any cache coherency for the data buffers.
* The application is responsible for handling cache coherency, if the cache
* is enabled.
*
* <b>Alignment</b>
*
* The VDMA supports any buffer alignment when DRE is enabled in the hardware
* configuration. It only supports word-aligned buffers otherwise. Note that
* "word" is defined by C_M_AXIS_MM2S_TDATA_WIDTH and C_S_AXIS_S2MM_TDATA_WIDTH
* for the read and write channel specifically.
*
* If the horizonal frame size is not word-aligned, then DRE must be enabled
* in the hardware. Otherwise, undefined results happen. 
*
* <b>Address Translation</b>
*
* Buffer addresses for transfers are physical addresses. If the system does not
* use MMU, then physical and virtual addresses are the same.
*
* <b>API Change from PLB Video DMA</b>
*
* We try to keep the API as consistent with the PLB Video DMA driver as
* possible. However, due to hardware differences, some of the PLB video DMA
* driver APIs are changed or removed. Two API functions are added to the AXI
* DMA driver.
*
* For details on the API changes, please refer to xaxivdma_porting_guide.h.
